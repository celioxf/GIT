    "# Git Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a software for version control. Basically, it allows us to track the changes we've made to a file or a directory. This becomes very seful when working in teams that write, because it allows multiple users to work separately on the same code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many good it tutorials in the internet, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4&list=PL-osiE80TeTuRUfjRe54Eea17-YfnOOAx), to learn basic git commands. However for someone getting started with git it can be tricky to understand the workflow of writing code, pushing to production, making changes, pulling new code and so on. For this reason, I'd like to show one of the ways that this can happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to demonstrate this workflow is by some practical examples. So, I went ahead and created three environments in Amazon Cloud 9 with git already installed: Master, Programmer One and Programmer Two. This should simulate and environment with a server running production code and two programmers making modifications to the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also created an empty repository in GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "![git_repo](imgs/git_repo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cloning the Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say Programmer One wants to start writing some code. We can clone the code base currently hosted in GitHub in a directory in our computer unsing the `clone` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "![clone](imgs/git_clone.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new directory in our file system and whichever changes we make to this directory or this files can now be synchronised with the code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "# .gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "What we did above can be very useful, however also very dangerous if we have some files (test files or even credentials) that we don't want to push to the code base. To avoid this, we can create a `.gitignore` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ignore](imgs/git_gitignore.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*The command above creates a file called passwords.txt, creates a file called `.gitignore` than puts the string 'passwords.txt' inside of the .gitignore file we have just created. From this point on, git won't track any changes made to this file anymore and won't push it to the original repository, if we commit any changes*.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've actually written some code, we can add it a staging area. This is done with the command `add` at it shows git which changes we want to push to the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I've created the file first_code.py. We can check how the staging area looks like now by using the `status` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "![git_status](imgs/git_status.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I've added the file to the staging area and I'm checking if everything went alright.\n",
    "\n",
    "![add](imgs/git_after_add.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, every file has been staged and is ready to be commited.\n",
    "\n",
    "![commit](imgs/git_commit_2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this code available to others, we can push it to the origin\n",
    "\n",
    "![push](imgs/git_push.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, we can see the changes in the GitHub repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "![repo_after_changes](imgs/git_commit_results.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting the Code into Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a code base (in this case hosted in GitHub) we can pull it into our Master server to use it in \"production\". For this, just like we did with the first programmer, we can simply clone the repository. Depending on the company, this will not be the responsability of the Programmer who wrote the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "![clone_master](imgs/git_clone_master.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the files are also available there. We can test the code (actually, there should be some extensive testing before pushing to production, but I'm trying to make this example as simple as possible)\n",
    "\n",
    "![python_run](imgs/git_python_first_run.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't get an error message, so it seens to be working. Nervertheless, we can add some functionality to monitor the code a bit better. This task will be assigned to programmer two. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Extending to Code Base\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Programmer Two has gotten the task of adding some logging functionalities to the code. He can clone the GitHub repository into his machine using the `close` command as we've seen and make his changes to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the code looks like now\n",
    "\n",
    "![logging](imgs/git_added_logging.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Programmer two has added (`add`) the code to the staging area and commited (`commit`) it to the main repo (`push`), we can see the changes in GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "![changes](imgs/git_remote_changes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notice that the commit message of the current code stand is also available* \n",
    "\n",
    "# Pulling Into Production (Again)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've pulled the code to the production server again, we can run our code and check if everythinf went as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pull_sucess](imgs/git_pull_success.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It worked. A new log file was created and we got summary information on the mock DataFrame that the code produces printed to screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a quick demonstration of how Git works. There is still a lot to coverage, for example, merge conflicts. However, the idea of this project was not to go into detail about the git commands, but rather to show how working with Git in a team looks like."
